# Tilfeldige ord
This is the source code behind [tilfeldigeord.no](https://tilfeldigeord.no/). The page is built using
[Astro](https://astro.build/) with static site generation.

The dictionary currently contains 912 Norwegian words that can be combined to create 830,832 unique compound words.

# Attributions
The favicon is the [Shuffle](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/shuffle/) icon,
by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Most of the Astro setup follows best practices, with previous inspiration from [Max BÃ¶ck](https://mxb.dev/)'s work on
the _excellent_ [Emergency Site Kit](https://github.com/maxboeck/emergency-site). So, thanks for that :smile:

# Also
All the content on the website is in Norwegian, but all the source code is in
English. Because why not.
