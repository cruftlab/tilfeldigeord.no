# Tilfeldige ord
This is the source code behind [tilfeldigeord.no](https://tilfeldigeord.no/). The page is built using
[Astro](https://astro.build/) with static site generation.

The dictionary currently contains mostly nouns (substantiv), and a few verbs. Suggestions for new words are very welcome!

# Suggest a new word
Create a new issue in GitHub, and write the word(s) you'd like to add, and preferably write whether it's a noun or a verb. 

I'll do my best to merge them promptly ðŸ™‚

# Attributions
The favicon is the [Shuffle](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/shuffle/) icon,
by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Site design has been inspired by the [Emergency Site Kit](https://github.com/maxboeck/emergency-site).

# Versioning
This project uses automated semantic versioning with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
Releases happen automatically when PRs are merged to main - no manual review needed.
See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for details on how to control version bumps through commit messages.

# Also
All the content on the website is in Norwegian, but all the source code is in
English. Because why not.
